## ðŸš€ NEXT STEPS

User Story #10 is now **COMPLETE** with all acceptance criteria met and additional security enhancements beyond requirements.

**Ready for frontend integration**: The backend now provides:
- Secure cookie-based refresh token handling
- Comprehensive token management APIs
- Account security with lockout protection  
- Administrative oversight capabilities
- Automated maintenance and cleanup

**Suggested next actions**:
1. Close User Story #10 in Azure DevOps
2. Move to frontend authentication components (User Stories #7, #9, #11)
3. Implement frontend integration with the enhanced backend APIs

## ðŸ“‹ BACKGROUND JOBS ACTIVE

The following scheduled jobs are now running:
- **Token Cleanup**: Every hour (removes expired blacklisted tokens)
- **Account Unlock**: Every 5 minutes (auto-unlock expired lockouts) 
- **Stale Token Cleanup**: Daily at 2 AM (removes old refresh tokens)
- **Session Cleanup**: Every 6 hours (placeholder for session store cleanup)

All background jobs handle graceful shutdown and provide comprehensive logging.
